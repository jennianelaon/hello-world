# hello-world
I am working through "What is Github?" tutorial!
I have been a middle school English teacher for eight years but have always been drawn to the techology side of education.  While this market has exploded, there are not many tools that truly get what students and teachers need.  I'm embarking on a new adventure to learn how to code and help fill that gap.
I'm also passionate about health and fitness.  I am a certifed Les Mills BodyPump, BodyAttack, and BodyJam instructor, and I'm working on my CXWORX certifcation.  I teach five group exercise classes a week at my local YMCA.
I eat a mostly plant-based diet to keep myself feeling great, but I will go to town on some chicken wings, nachos, and cupcakes every once in a while.
